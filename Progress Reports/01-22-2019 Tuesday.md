### Group Attendees
1. Angeline Alfred
2. Ashten Bontrager
3. Timothy Koba
4. Huanle Zhou

### Summary
General team-sponsor concerns were also discussed. We've agreed with Tania to email to her weekly progress reports. Also, we will provide both Tania and Thomas with links to our GitHub repository and our live Gantt chart. We also finalized our Design Specifications Document (DSD) and submitted it for review to Thomas and Tania.

### Future Goal
Get the DSD approved and signed by Tania and Thomas so we can move on from documentation concerns to more technical development.
