### Summary
The primary focus of the meeting was developing a Design Specifications Document (DSD).
Writing the DSD forces us to clearly express our understanding of the project. It should
clear up any misunderstandings about the requirements of the project. We worked on a DSD
but did not finish.

### Issues
None, except the DSD is not finished yet.

### Future goals
Finish the DSD.
