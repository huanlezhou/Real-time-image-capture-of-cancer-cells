2. Angeline Alfred(Remote)
2. Timothy Koba
3. Huanle Zhou (Remote)

### Summary 

The GUI is functionally finished but could use improvements for better organization/appearance. The Z-stack acquisition code is still not a callable function. Active cell detection is complete. Detection was done using nuclear channel to verify the presence of cells and the cancer detection channel to verify if the detected cells are active based on the cellular fluorescent light intensity.

### Accomplishments
• Successfully detect cells using Nuclear channel and active cancer channel

### Issues
• Making the Z-stack acquisition function callable

## Requests to the Sponsor
• None

### Goals for next meeting
• Integrate the Cancer detection plugins with the GUI
• Resolve the Z-stack acquisition function callability issue \
• Generate code to check if stage has exceeded the XY bounds set by the user
