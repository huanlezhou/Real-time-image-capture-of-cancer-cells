### Group Attendees
1. Angeline Alfred
2. Ashten Bontrager
3. Huanle Zhou
4. Timothy Koba

### Summary
The group discussed general concerns and actions to be taken to receive a good grade on the project. A 
major point that was discussed was the need to produce and maintain documentation of the project. 
Weekly progress reports should be written discussing project progress and obstacles. A Project Design 
Specification (PDS) document should be written to communicate to our sponsor CytoImage Dx our 
understanding of what the final product must do and the constraints and/or assumptions of the design.
A document explaining the plan of action and the workflow must also be written. Some revision and 
addition was done on an existing, but incomplete, PDS document that was provided by Angeline.

### Issues
The PDS, an essential document, is still not complete. Detailed low-level solutions to the problem were
being discussed. This became somewhat of a distraction and impeded the writing of the high-level PDS.
