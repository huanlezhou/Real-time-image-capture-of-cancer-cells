### Group Attendees
1. Asthen Bontrager
2. Timothy Koba

### Summary
__Timothy__: Worked on getting his Z-stack acquisition code (Java) executable in Icy script but was 
later informed that Icy script will not be used at all in the final product. So abandoned this effort. 
After delivering my code to Ashten for use, I troubleshooted and speculated with him why it was not 
"visible" when integrating modules of the program.

__Ashten__: Got Timothy's code working after copying and pasting it into his, instead of trying to keep
it as a separate module. Resolved the endless loop issue from last week. The issue was a check for equality instead
of checking for less than or equal to. The check for equality assumes the stage will move to the exact maxima 
inputted by the user, a very slim possibility.

### Accomplishments
• Z-stack acquisition code working in Java.
• Endless loop is resolved.

### Issues
• Don't know what extrema the leftmost stage position corresponds to, maximum x position or minimum.

### Requests to the Sponsor
• Formula for determining the window size.

### Goals for next meeting
• Determine what the leftmost and rightmost stage positions corresponds to. \
