### Group Attendees
1. Angeline Alfred
2. Timothy Koba

### Summary
Timothy successfully troubleshooted and discovered that the drivers for the microscope were already 
installed on the computer. Angeline was able to establish communication between the microscope and 
Micro-Manager by adjusting the anticipated baud rate in Micro-manager. We created a configuration 
file from scratch which described the hardware configuration to Micro-manager. This allowed us to 
control the microscope, the stage (in all three directions), the camera, and the light source. These 
accomplishments prove that the present operating system on the T3500 will be able to do the job. This 
also moves the project from establishing communication between the computer and the hardware to 
integrating and developing software to automate the image acquisition and filtering process.
