### Summary
Huanle created a structure that runs saving images under two different conditions (Taking images of all channels/Channel 2 and cancer cell channel only).
However, this part of the code is heavily depending on other sub functions, eg: inside of this structure, it has sub functions like Z-stack initialization, Go to specific channel state, Snapping and saving images...etc. And inside of each these sub functions, it also included sub sub-functions like Saving images in an organized format (Single channel state with different z-stack images compact in one file), file names, file name format…etc. Current progress is big structure has created, working on finishing each sub functions, and how to convert all these sub-function code into a function/class, and call the sub function in the main structure, so that the code is easy to follow and debug.


Timothy tried to modify his nested-loop construct to writeout a single .tiff image file containing all the z-slices for a particular channel and stage xy-position. Currently the construct can successfully acquire all the z-slice images for each channel, but can't write them out so that each .tiff file has only images pertaining to one channel. This in part due to the complexity and inexperience with the complex 5-dimensional data structure called a "Sequence" in Icy. Was able to generate a .tiff file containing all channels for a particular z-slice in ImageJ however. 

### Accomplishments


### Issues
• Writing out all the different z-slice images in one .tiff file per channel

### Requests to the Sponsor
_None._

### Goals for next meeting
• Z-stack image acquisition and writeout for each channel.
