### Summary
Huanle created a structure that runs saving images under two different conditions (Taking images of all channels/Channel 2 and cancer cell channel only).
However, this part of the code is heavily depending on other sub functions, eg: inside of this structure, it has sub functions like Z-stack initialization, Go to specific channel state, Snapping and saving images...etc. And inside of each these sub functions, it also included sub sub-functions like Saving images in an organized format (Single channel state with different z-stack images compact in one file), file names, file name formatâ€¦etc. Current progress is big structure has created, working on finishing each sub functions, and how to convert all these sub-function code into a function/class, and call the sub function in the main structure, so that the code is easy to follow and debugging.
