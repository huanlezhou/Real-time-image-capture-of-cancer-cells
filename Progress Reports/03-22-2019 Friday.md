### Summary
Encountered an error with Icy and had to reinstall to get live view of the sample working. Found that the stage
repositioning gets stuck in a loop. We need to figure out why and break out of it. This issue pertains to the
"Determine If End of Slide... Reached" subject of the [Gantt chart](https://prod.teamgantt.com/gantt/schedule/?ids=1432769&public_keys=M1SEDd8Q6NcE&zoom=d100&font_size=12&estimated_hours=0&assigned_resources=1&percent_complete=1&documents=0&comments=1&col_width=355&hide_header_tabs=0&menu_view=1&resource_filter=1&name_in_bar=0&name_next_to_bar=1&resource_names=1#user=&company=&custom=&date_filter=&hide_completed=false&color_filter=), currently at 0%. Must determine the window size
for how much to reposition the stage so that the pictures taken across the sample cover all the area of the sample without
recapturing the same area multiple times.


### Accomplishments
• Live view in Icy is working again.


### Issues
• Stage repositioning code gets stuck in an endless loop. 

### Requests to the Sponsor
• Formula for determining the window size.

### Goals for next meeting
• Get the Z-stack program as a usable plugin in Icy, not just as an Icy script. \
• Resolve the endless loop issue. \
• Integrate the already built functions into one cohesive Icy program.
