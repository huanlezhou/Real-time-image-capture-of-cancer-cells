### Group Attendees
1. Asthen Bontrager
2. Timothy Koba
3. Huanle Zhou

### Summary 
Discussed some team organization and communication concerns. Specifically about recording in-meeting progress and getting progress report emails out on time to Tania.

Decided on using two image capturing functions after a discussion with the group; two different functions will be used for acquiring images, one in the event there are cells of interest, the other if there are not.  

Added stage z-position adjustment code to Timothy's z-stack acquisition function to reflect that channels will be in focus at slightly different z-positions.

### Accomplishments
• Had a meeting on organization and communication. \
• Discussed the Gantt Chart, where are we at, and what we need to do. \
• Addressed z-position stage adjustment for each channel in the image acquisition process. \
• Converted the z-stack image acquisition script to a reusable function.

## Requests to the Sponsor

### Goals for next meeting
