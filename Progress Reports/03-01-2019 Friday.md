### Summary 

We made a decision on Image-taking function calls after a disscusion with the group; the result from the discussion was to come up with two different methods of function calls. One of them is pass values to both paths(Taking all channel & DIC and canser cell channel only) using only Taking all channel and all Z-stacks function; another is to have two different functions for each path. At the end, we can test the code to see which method works better.
