### Summary

Today we recreated the configuration file for Micro-manager to control the microscope and its accessories. With the current setup we were able to take a live video of cells on a sample slide. We were able to adjust the focus, move the stage in the x-y directions, and close and open the shutter to take pictures. This verifies that micro-manager, the microscope, the camera, the other accessories, are working together properly. Basic functionality such as image capture, moving/focusing the image by controlling the stage has been achieved.

After this, Ashten was able to import the configuration file from micro-manager to ICY. Within ICY he was able to use the camera for live video feed, and move the stage in its direction (X, Y, Z). ICY is the integrating software we intend to use to communicate between Micro-manager (plug-in) and an image processing software to implement our proposed solution to this project.



### Issues
Controlling all accessories, such as, channel selection, magnifier selection, etc... directly from Micromanager/ICY.
