### Summary

Today, we recreated the configuration file for Micro-manager to help control the microscope and its accessories. With the current setups, we were able to take a live video of cells on a sample slide. We were able to adjust the focus and move the stage in an x-y direction, and as well as closing and opening the shutter to take pictures.This acheivement allows us to verify the communication between micro-manager, the microscope, the camera, and other accessories, was working properly. And the system was capable of performing basic function, such as, image capture, moving/focusing the image by controling the position of the stage.

After this accomplishment, Ashten was able to import the configuration file from micro-manager to ICY. Within ICY he was able to use the camera for live feed video, and move the stage in multiple direction (X, Y, Z). ICY is the integrating software we intend to use to communicate between Micro-manager (plug-in) and an image processing software to implement our proposed solution to this project.



### Issues
Controlling all accessories, such as, Channel filtering, magnifyer selectivity, etc... directly from Micromanager/ICY.
