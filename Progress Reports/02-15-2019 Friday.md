2. Asthen Bontrager
3. Huanle Zhou
4. Timothy Koba

### Summary
The Icy script commands to operate the reflector turret, that is, select the different "channels",
were discovered. This was a big setback previously. Also, objective selection too. 
A for-loop construct was written in Icy which easily identifies property names of 
hardware devices that can be set. Knowing the property names is essential to setting their 
values. It can also be used to determine device labels and valid property values/settings. 
Learned that code in Eclipse will be very similar to, if not identical, to the scripts that can be
run from Icy script editor. This allows us to test scipts before creating a plugin. An
encountered setback/issue is developing a test plugin. Huanle developed her algorithm for
image acquisiton with two channels (DIC and cancer-determing channel).
