### Summary
Accomplished successful z-stack image acquisition and writeout. We can now create a .tiff 
image file containing multiple z-slices under one channel for viewing in ImageJ. Previously a single 
z-slice could be viewed under all the different channels, but not multiple slices under one channel
in one .tiff file. This was a major breakthrough.


### Accomplishments
• Z-stack image acquisition and writeout


### Issues
• Modularizing our Icy script/code. 

### Requests to the Sponsor
• Review the Design Specifications Document and submit any requests for corrections/revisions.

### Goals for next meeting
• Get the Design Specifications Document signed by the Sponsor.
