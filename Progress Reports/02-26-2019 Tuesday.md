### Summary
Accomplished successful z-stack image acquisition and writeout. We can now create a .tiff 
image file containing multiple z-slices under one channel for viewing in ImageJ. Previously a single 
z-slice could be viewed under all the different channels, but not multiple slices under one channel
in one .tiff file. This was a major breakthrough.

We are succesfully able to detect the presence of cells in an image and this will be leveraged to determine the relative intensity of the cells, which can be used to determine if the image has cells of interest or not.
