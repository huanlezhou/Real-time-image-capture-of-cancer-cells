### Group Attendees
1. Angeline Alfred 
2. Asthen Bontrager
3. Huanle Zhou _(remote)_
4. Timothy Koba

### Summary
Timothy wrote code to restore the initial position of the XY-stage after user input, 
which determines the four extrema of the slide positioning, is taken from Ashten's user interface. Also 
wrote a nested-loop that successfully iterates through all the light channels and moves the stage up/down 
in the z-direction. This will help in z-stack image acquisition.
