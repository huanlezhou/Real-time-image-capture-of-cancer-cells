### Group Attendees
1. Timothy Koba

### Summary
Timothy Koba went in and opened up the Dell Precision T3500 to look at the PCI board installed on the computer.
The PCI board allows for the computer and the CoolSNAP ES camera to communicate. He acquired an image of the PCI 
board centered on the main chip present on the PCI board. The image provides us with the chip details needed to discuss
Windows 10 x64 compatibility with CoolSNAP in case an updated configuration is pursued.
