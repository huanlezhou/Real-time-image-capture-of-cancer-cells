### Group Attendees
1. Angeline Alfred
2. Ashten Bontrager
3. Huanle Zhou
4. Timothy Koba

### Summary
Ashten came with copies of micro-manager (1.4.22), Icy, and an updated version of Java on a flash drive.
Installed micro-manager and Icy and attempted configuring them with the microscope. This included describing the setup,
i.e. which devices are used and their communication protocols, to micro-manager's device manager.
All this was done in attempt to establish communication between the computer and micro-manager. There are three
interconnections to the Dell Precision T3500 we're worrying about.

### Successes
The computer detects the camera and the microscope (as a USB device).

### Failures
Cannot select the AxioImager M2 on micro-manager's hardware configuration wizard. Possibly due to a missing driver. 
The RS232 connection seems to be non-functional. Unplugging the RS232 does not result in device manager refreshing and
detecting a new device.
