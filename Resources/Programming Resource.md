# Wonderful & Free Online Programming Resource
### _A note from Timothy_
Hey Team!

I found a wonderful online archive, or "school", for learning JavaScript and other programming languages!
Press this [hyperlink](https://www.w3schools.com/js) to navigate there! Since we're going with JavaScript,
the link I provided takes you to the JavaScript database. Just change the selected tab at the top of the
page for any other language you need. Any other great resources? Add sections to this .md file please!
